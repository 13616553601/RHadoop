# Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/RHadoop/wiki) for information. This repo is no longer used to develop the RHadoop packages, which have moved into separate repos: [rhdfs](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/rhdfs), [rhbase](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/rhbase), [rmr2](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/rmr2), [plyrmr](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/plyrmr), [quickcheck](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/quickchek).
This repo is now read-only for the source code part. The issues will be progressively closed and transitioned to one of the specific repos. The wiki will remain here.
